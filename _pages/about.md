I am a PhD Candidate and Junior Researcher at the <strong>Group of Artificial Intelligence for People and Society</strong> ([GAIPS](https://gaips.inesc-id.pt/)), part of [INESC-ID](https://www.inesc-id.pt/), Lisbon.
My research focuses on the intersection of computer science, evolutionary biology and behavioural economics: [understanding how did cooperative behaviour evolve](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.309.5731.93).
To that end, I develop computational models of the evolution of strategic behaviours, employing Evolutionary Game Theory as the main tool.

My PhD research has a particular focus on how the evolution of social intelligence endows humans with the capacity to overcome limitations of reputation-based cooperation, a mechanism often considered responsible for the evolution of language and large-scale societies. In such a context, where reputations and social norms sustain cooperative behaviour between strangers, I aim to investigate the roles of memory, emotion, empathy and other intrinsic aspects of human social life.
I am currently supervised by Professors [Francisco C. Santos](https://web.ist.utl.pt/franciscocsantos/) and [Rui Prada](https://gaips.inesc-id.pt/team/rui-prada/), and have previously worked under the supervision of [Ana Paiva](https://ana-paiva.com/), [Jorge M. Pacheco](https://atpgroup.org/jmp/) and [Fernando P. Santos](https://fp-santos.github.io/).

I am also interested in designing trustworthy and fair artificial intelligence for social good, particularly in its governance and role in fostering fair, cooperative, and just (hybrid) societies.
